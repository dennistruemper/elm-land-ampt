# elm-land and ampt

example deployment: [https://solid-data-ush4cf.ampt.app/](https://solid-data-ush4cf.ampt.app/)

## What are these?

### [Elm Land](https://elm.land)

Single Page Application Framework with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)

### [ampt](https://getampt.com)

A self provisioning runtime to have code runnig in AWS without managing infrastructure. Can host Websites too.

## Why put these together?

I like the ideas of Elm and the community a lot. Elm Land takes away a lot of the wiering and has awesome documentation. But I also need some backend. But I do not want to want to turn all the knobs the infrastructure provider has to offer. Also I really like the idea of serverless. Thats why I thought Elm Land and ampt are worth a try.
This repository got created to showcase this combo. I can imagine a lot of developers don't know both of these.
